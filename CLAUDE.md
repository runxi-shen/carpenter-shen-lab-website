# Carpenter-Shen Lab Website

Academic lab website for the **Carpenter-Shen Lab** at **Purdue University**.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** (v5) — static site generator, content-first architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** (v3) — utility-first styling
- **MDX** — Markdown with components for content pages
- Content is managed via **Astro Content Collections** with Zod schemas in `src/content.config.ts`

## Key Conventions

### Images
- All images live in `src/assets/images/` and are imported in component frontmatter (`import img from '...'`), NOT referenced as string paths from `public/`.
- `public/` is only for files the browser fetches directly by URL (favicon, robots.txt, CNAME).
- This ensures correct path resolution regardless of `base` URL config.

### Color Scheme
- Single light theme: warm cream hero/nav + white content cards, with a single dark footer.
- No theme switcher (dropped per Anne's feedback, issue #2).
- All colors use CSS custom properties in `src/assets/styles/global.css`.
- **Light surfaces** (hero, nav, content): warm cream page (#FAF7EF), white cards (#FFFFFF), dark text (#1A1A1A). Accents are Boilermaker Gold (#CFB991), Aged Gold (#8E6F3E, AA-safe for text/links), and Rush Gold (#DAAA00).
- **Footer**: the only dark surface, near-black (#1A1A1A) with Boilermaker Gold accents.
- **Legacy `--accent-teal`** now aliases Rush Gold (#DAAA00); teal is not in the Purdue palette (see [`.agents/skills/purdue-brand/reference/color.md`](.agents/skills/purdue-brand/reference/color.md)). Avoid using it for text on white (low contrast).
- Purdue brand reference: https://marcom.purdue.edu/our-brand/visual-identity/
- **Authoritative brand rules for this repo** live in [`.agents/skills/purdue-brand/`](.agents/skills/purdue-brand/) (palette, typography, logo, voice, checklist).

### Typography (single typeface: Plus Jakarta Sans)
- **The entire site uses one font: Plus Jakarta Sans** (free, Google Fonts). Per Runxi's preference, the old serif (Source Serif 4) and the Barlow family were dropped — do not reintroduce them.
- Purdue's real brand fonts (Acumin Pro, United Sans) are **paid Adobe Fonts** and cannot be self-hosted on the public GitHub Pages site, so Plus Jakarta Sans stands in as a free Acumin/Proxima-style geometric sans. To use real Acumin, an Adobe Fonts web-project kit ID would be required.
- All five font CSS variables (`--font-display`, `--font-heading`, `--font-body`, `--font-label`, `--font-condensed` in `global.css`) point to Plus Jakarta Sans. Kept as separate tokens for flexibility, but currently identical.
- **Two sources of truth for fonts** — `global.css` (CSS variables) AND `tailwind.config.mjs` (`fontFamily`, used by `font-*` utility classes like the footer's `font-body`). Change BOTH when swapping fonts, and **restart the dev server** (Tailwind config is not hot-reloaded).
- The wordmark **CARPENTER-SHEN LAB** uses Plus Jakarta at natural width (no condensed squeeze — `scaleX` distorts the letterforms).
- Section header pattern: a larger eyebrow (`.section-label`, ~1.2rem) over a smaller `h2` heading (capped ~2.5rem) so the pair reads balanced.
- Body paragraphs are globally `text-align: justify`; section subtitles under headers should be `text-center` to override it.

### Hosting
- Currently configured for GitHub Pages at `runxi-shen.github.io/carpenter-shen-lab-website` (`base: '/carpenter-shen-lab-website'` in `astro.config.mjs` — must match the exact GitHub repo name `runxi-shen/carpenter-shen-lab-website`, otherwise every asset 404s in production)
- To switch to a Purdue domain: set `site: 'https://carpenter-shen-lab.purdue.edu'`, `base: '/'`, and add a `CNAME` file in `public/`
- GitHub Actions deploy workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Content

### People
- **Anne E. Carpenter** — Principal Investigator, Professor
- **Runxi Shen** — Co-Principal Investigator, Research Assistant Professor
- **Shantanu Singh** — Senior Consultant (not shown on homepage yet, maybe shown as a team member later), still need to consult Shantanu/Anne for their preferences

### Writing Style
- No em dashes in body text. Use commas or restructure sentences instead.
- Body paragraphs are justified (both-side aligned).
- Section headers use the `.section-label` class (uppercase Plus Jakarta, gold, flanked by decorative lines).

## Design workflow

Two skills cover frontend design on this repo. Use them together:

- **[purdue-brand](.agents/skills/purdue-brand/SKILL.md)** — encodes Purdue Marcom rules (palette, type, logo, voice, 77° diagonals). Loads first so brand constraints are in scope.
- **[impeccable](.agents/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md)** — design quality, composition, motion, audit. Reads `PRODUCT.md` + `DESIGN.md` at the repo root, which are already seeded with the Purdue rules.

Typical sequence for a visual change:

```
/purdue-brand audit            # baseline compliance check
/impeccable shape <surface>     # plan the design within brand constraints
/impeccable craft <surface>     # implement
/purdue-brand audit            # confirm no regressions
```

When brand and impeccable conflict (e.g. impeccable's "use OKLCH, never `#000`" vs Purdue's required exact hex values), **brand wins** for identity (colors, fonts, logo), impeccable wins for everything else (hierarchy, motion, spacing, contrast strategy).

## Development

```bash
npm run dev      # Local dev server at localhost:4321/carpenter-shen-lab
npm run build    # Static build to dist/
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```
